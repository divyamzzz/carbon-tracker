## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login process for users to create an account and access their carbon footprint data.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation**: Calculates the carbon emissions based on the device's data consumption and associated electricity usage.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides users with tailored steps to reduce their carbon emissions if they exceed the safe range.
- **Congratulatory Messages**: Displays a congratulatory message if the user's carbon footprint is within the safe range.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface accessible on various devices.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern design.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system to store user data and carbon footprint calculations.

### Other Tools
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing passwords before storing them in the database.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- PostgreSQL database set up.
- Git installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyamzzz/carbon-tracker.git
   cd carbon-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:**

   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the PostgreSQL database:**

   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file located in the `backend` directory with your PostgreSQL connection string.

   Example `.env` file:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/carbon_tracker
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   # Start the backend server
   cd backend
   nodemon app.js
   
   # Start the frontend development server
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server should be running on `http://localhost:5000`, and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account by providing your email and a secure password.
2. **Login**: Access your account using the email and password you registered with.
3. **View Carbon Footprint**: After logging in, you can view the carbon emissions calculated based on your device's data consumption.
4. **Receive Feedback**: If your carbon emissions are within the safe range, you'll receive a congratulatory message. Otherwise, you'll be provided with actionable steps to reduce your carbon footprint.

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database schema consists of the following tables:

- **Users**: Stores user information such as email, hashed password, and account details.
- **CarbonFootprint**: Stores carbon footprint data, including user ID, data consumption, electricity usage, and calculated emissions.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints used in the application:

- **POST /api/auth/signup**: Create a new user account.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Login and receive a JWT token.
- **GET /api/carbon-footprint**: Fetch the carbon footprint for the logged-in user.
- **POST /api/carbon-footprint**: Calculate and store the carbon footprint based on user data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch.
